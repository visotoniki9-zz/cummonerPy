# CummonerPy
This is a simple script to download all the chapters from [The Cummoner](https://totempole666.com/) adult webcomic from its official website, all neatly organized per chapters.  
This script also exists in Javascript/Node: [https://github.com/visotoniki9/cummonerPy](https://github.com/visotoniki9/cummonerJs)
## How to run 
```
pdm install
python cummoner.py
```
It will create a downloads folder, and inside a folder for each chapter like based on the title like, 'I. First Time For Everything', now in order not to put too much load on the website and get your ip banned I made it a bit slower than it could be still it only takes about 2min to download all the chapters.
